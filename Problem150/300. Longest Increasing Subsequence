# Let dp[i] is the longest increase subsequence of nums[0..i] which has nums[i] as the end element of the subsequence.

class Solution:
    def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        dp = [1] * len(nums)
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            for j in range(i):
                if nums[i] > nums[j]:
                    dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)

        return max(dp)
